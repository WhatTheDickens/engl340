# Dates and Activities

- 👋

### Before class

- Read all the pages in the "Meet Your Computer" module and do your best to carry out the instructions. Take notes on anything you weren't able to accomplish.
- Your computer's graphical user interface (GUI) may differ from what you see in the module's illustrations, depending on the version of your operating system. For example, the illustrations show the location of certain options and settings as they appear in Windows 10, but you may be running Windows 11. Don't give up! See if you can find them anyway. Again, take notes on anything you can't figure out.

### In class
