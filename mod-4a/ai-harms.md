# AI Harms

Many concerns have been raised about the harm that AI could do&mdash;or already does&mdash;to individuals, communities, or the human race as a whole.

Might a sentient, malevolent AI turn against its creators and destroy humanity? This is a potential harm that AI developers, in particular, seem keen to consider. But bear in mind that if developers have an incentive to hype all the good things AI might do for us, they also have an incentive to hype scenarios of AI apocalypse. In both bright and dark visions of an AI future, AI is depicted as extremely powerful, as are its creators.  

Meanwhile, focusing too much on AI doom scenarios may distract our attention from the significant, if more prosaic, harms that AI is causing right now. It's important to consider that

- AI tools replicate and thereby amplify the biases and misinformation in the data they're trained on, which can lead to discimination when automated systems are used to make decisions about, for example, hiring, lending, or criminal sentencing.
- AI tools, which can't distinguish fact from falsehood, frequently "invent" facts and output citations to nonexistent sources.
- Much of the content used to train AI tools is copyrighted, raising questions about the legality of this training.
- [AI "slop"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year) on social media and elsewhere makes it more difficult for users to access the content that truly interests them.
- AI tools have made it easier than ever to create and circulate misinformation and disinformation, polluting civic discourse and distorting the political process.
- AI tools for generating image content have led to new forms of sexual exploitation and harassment.
- AI tools have complicated the task of educators by making it harder to detect cheating.
- The data centers that make cloud-based AI tools available at scale consume large quantities of energy and water, resulting in significant potential for adverse effects on the environment and on the communities where these centers are located.
- To reduce the amount of toxic (e.g., racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, antisemitic, violent) content produced by the major AI tools available to the public, the companies that create them rely heavily on human labor that is typically poorly compensated.

The impact of AI on labor and the environment tends to receive less attention than the other concerns listed above.

This brief segment of the show *60 minutes* offers an introduction to the issue of poorly paid "humans in the loop":
