# Resources

The literature on AI is large and ever-growing. You'll find many useful resources in the Geneseo Center for Digital Learning's [public Zotero library](https://genai.geneseo.sunycreate.cloud/2024/10/23/how-to-use-the-cdls-public-zotero-library/). If you're interested in learning how Geneseo faculty are using AI in the classroom or in reading Geneseo faculty perspectives on AI, take a look at the website [GenAI: AI at Geneseo](https://genai.geneseo.sunycreate.cloud/). You may even want to consider contributing your own perspective as a student to the site, which invites blog posts from all members of the Geneseo campus community.
