# What is Artificial Intelligence?

Although there's no universally accepted definition of "artificial intelligence" in computing, the term is commonly used to describe one or more of the following:

- an area of research within computer science
- a property that some researchers claim (controversially) belongs or could belong to certain computer systems
- a set of technologies for generating new content (text, images, sound, etc.) from existing content

The last item on that list has given rise to the term "generative artificial intelligence" or, for short, "GenAI." While GenAI isn't new, it suddenly seems to be everywhere: not only in free-standing tools with names such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, DALL-E, and Midjourney, but also, increasingly, as an affordance built into other tools, such as search engines, word-processors, image editors, email and messaging interfaces, mobile apps, coding environments, websites, cars, and home appliances.

In this module, we'll make some use of GenAI and consider some of the ethical concerns currently being raised around its impact on society and the environment. But first, it will be helpful to put GenAI and artificial intelligence (AI) as a whole in some historical perspective. Data scientist William J.B. Mattingly's series of videos on AI and machine learning is a good place to start. Watch the first video in the series, below, to get a brief introduction to how artificial intelligence fits into the larger history of computing.
