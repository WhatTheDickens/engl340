# Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks

## Machine Learning

If the idea that there could be "intelligent" or "thinking" machines remains highly questionable, there's no question that the algorithms underpinning contemporary AI systems are distinctly different from those that dominated early efforts to program computers to take action in response to a set of circumstances.

In those early efforts, so-called "expert systems" equipped computers with a "knowledge base"&mdash;a set of facts about a given domain&mdash;and a set of logic-based rules to apply to those facts. In the classic example, a computer so equipped could make moves in a game like checkers or chess based on an enormous amount of previously stored information about past games and a set of rules for responding to new situations in a game as they arose.

By contrast, contemporary AI systems rely much more heavily on statistical inference and prediction; they use probability to respond to previously unencountered situations, and they're capable of improving their responses by "learning" from feedback on their actions.

Indeed, "machine learning" is the generic label applied to computer systems capable of improving their output continuously in response to feedback. It's important to recognize, however, that as in the case of "intelligence" and "thinking," machine "learning" is driven by processes fundamentally different from those that drive *human* learning. The more the designers and marketers of AI systems use the language of human perception and cognition to describe what these systems do, the easier it becomes to anthropomorphize the machines themselves. Unless we keep at least mental quotation marks around AI terminology borrowed from the things a human brain does (operating in coordination with the rest of the human body it belongs to), we're at risk of reaching some peculiar conclusions&mdash;one example, arguably, is the claim some are now making that AI systems, like humans, deserve, or will eventually deserve, to be treated [as "persons" bearing rights](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10682746/).  

## Deep Learning and Neural Networks





<!-- As the video you watched in the previous section ([What is Aritificial Intelligence?]({{ site.url }}/what-is-ai)) makes clear, artificial intelligence is distinguished from other computational methods by its use of "deep learning." Unlike "hard-coded" algorithms that instruct a computer to carry out a specified series commands or allow it to choose an action based on information previously supplied to it (such as actual chess matches), machine learning algorithms use statistical inference to enable a computer to predict outcomes and revise those predictions in response to feedback. Over time, the computer "learns" from repeated feedback to make better and better predictions.

We need to keep those quotation marks around the word *learns* because this mode of learning is different from human learning. Much of the terminology associated with artificial intelligence suggests an analogy with human mental processing, and that's probably fine as long as we keep in mind that it's *only* an analogy. But as we saw from the video in the previous section, the history of artificial intelligence in computing is bound up with efforts to emulate or compete with human intelligence, and one consequence of this effort seems to be a tendency, on the part of some researchers and corporations, to deliberately obscure the difference between them. We'll return to this tendency in the section on AI and ethics.

The second video in William J.B. Mattingly's series explains a core tool of artificial intelligence named for the human anatomical feature it's designed to emulate: the *neural network*. Again, keep in mind that the structure and behavior of the neural networks used in computing is not the same as the structure and behavior of the actual networked neurons in the human brain.
