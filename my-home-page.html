<h2 id="what-the-course-is-about">What the course is about</h2>
<p>In this course, we’ll work together to understand how computers have
changed the field of possibilities for studying books—in particular,
books of the kind usually classified as “literature.”</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll need some base level of understanding for the two
parts of our equation: computers on the one hand, books on the other.
<em>Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the
Internet</em>, by Claire L. Evans, will help us establish a base-level
understanding of computers that’s not just technical but historical,
with an emphasis on the frequently neglected role of women in the
history of computing. <em>The Book</em>, by Amaranth Borsuk, will
introduce us to the material and conceptual history of the book.</p>
<p>We’ll also need a particular book that we can keep coming back to in
order to test what computers can help us do with literature. <a
href="https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/walden/"><em>Walden</em></a>,
by Henry David Thoreau, will be that book. Because <em>Walden</em> is a
book that’s partly about technology, in which the author has some
provocative things to say about literature, it will also help us think
more broadly about the relationship between books and computers.</p>
<p>Finally, everyone will need to have a working computer running the
software required to do the things we want our computers to do with
literature. Specifically, you’ll need a laptop running a reasonably
up-to-date version of Windows, macOS, or Linux. Chromebooks, tablets,
and phones won’t suffice. You’ll need to bring your laptop to every
class. If your laptop breaks down or is lost or stolen, you’ll need to
find a substitute.</p>
<h2 id="whos-teaching-the-course">Who’s teaching the course</h2>
<p>I’m Paul Schacht, Professor of English and <a

<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes</h2>
<h3 id="individual-learning-outcomes">Individual learning outcomes</h3>
<p>What will you know and be able to do as a result of taking this
course? First, because this is a 300-level English course, you’ll
improve your</p>
<ul>
<li>ability to read texts in relation to history</li>
<li>understanding of how texts are related to social and cultural
categories (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, ability),
enterprises (e.g. philosophy, science, politics), and institutions
(e.g., of religion, of education)</li>
<li>understanding of how language as a system or linguistic change over
time inform literature as an aesthetic object, expressive medium, or
social document</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, as a result of taking ENGL 340, you should</p>
<ul>
<li>understand, at a basic level, the computational dimension of
language and literature</li>
<li>understand, at a basic level, some common uses of computation and
computational tools in the study of literature</li>
<li>feel prepared to use computational methods and tools for literary
analysis and interpretation in another literature course</li>
<li>know more about how your computer works than you did before</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="community-learning-outcomes">Community learning outcomes</h3>
<p>What will we accomplish in this course as a community?</p>

points for a group project to which you contribute, with
<strong>10</strong> of those points coming from your personal
contribution to the project and a final blog post you’ll write about

</ul>
<h2 id="tools-and-accounts">Tools and accounts</h2>
<p>In addition to a working laptop computer running an up-to-date
version of macOS, Windows, or Linux, you’ll need some additional tools
and accounts. The modules explain how to obtain the last two of these,
so don’t rush out in search of them until we’ve discussed them in
class.</p>
<ul>
<li>An account at <a href="https://sunygeneseoenglish.org">English @
SUNY Geneseo</a></li>
<li>An account at <a href="https://commons.digitalthoreau.org">The

<h2 id="do-you-have-a-disability">Do you have a disability?</h2>
<p>SUNY Geneseo will make reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented physical, emotional or learning disabilities. Accommodations
will be made for medical conditions related to pregnancy or parenting.
Requests for accommodations including letters or review of existing
accommodations should be directed to the <a
href="https://www.geneseo.edu/accessibility-office">Office of
Accessibility Services</a> in Erwin 22. If you have an accommodation
letter, let me know as soon as possible in the semester so we can
discuss specific arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="take-care-of-yourself">Take care of yourself</h2>
<p>It’s hard work being a student! You can improve your chances of
success by eating well, getting enough sleep, and making wise choices.
<strong>If you need help, ask for it.</strong> <a
href="https://www.geneseo.edu/health">Student Health and Counseling</a>
can help you if you’re sick or need psychological or emotional support.
A variety of <a
href="https://www.geneseo.edu/library/center-academic-excellence">Campus
Learning Centers</a>, including the <a
href="https://www.geneseo.edu/english/leadership-and-hands-learning#writing-learning-center">Writing
Learning Center</a>, offer academic support services. <strong>And then
there’s me.</strong> <a href="https://schacht.youcanbook.me">Schedule an
appointment</a> to see me in my office or meet online for help with
assignments, to tell me if you’re facing basic obstacles to success such
as food insecurity, or to continue the conversation about readings and
topics in the course. If reading or discussing certain kinds of content
in this course might prove traumatic for you, let me know and we’ll work
together to figure out a reasonable solution. You should be prepared for
the fact that some works on the syllabus contain depictions of or
allusions to violence and sexuality.</p>
<h2 id="think-about-others">Think about others</h2>
<ul>
<li>Express yourself honestly but respectfully</li>
