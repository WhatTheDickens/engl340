# Working with Web Images

{: .intro}
Images on the web created and served according to a standard known as the "International Image Operability Framework"&mdash;IIIF for short&mdash;offer great flexibility to digital scholarly editors interested in telling stories with or about them. This module introduces you to the IIIF standard and some ways you can use the Huntington Library's IIIF images of the *Walden* manuscript.
