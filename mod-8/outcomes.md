# Module Description

Images on the web created and served according to a standard known as the "International Image Operability Framework"&mdash;IIIF for short&mdash;offer great flexibility to digital scholarly editors interested in telling stories with or about them. This module introduces you to the IIIF standard and some ways you can use the Huntington Library's IIIF images of the *Walden* manuscript.

# Learning Outcomes

At the completion of this module you should

1. Understand what the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is and why it's used by digital scholarly editors
2. Be able to incorporate IIIF images into a web page in a variety of ways

# Dates and Activities

## Monday, April 6

### Before class

- Review [Attributes, Links, Images]({{ site.url }}/mod-7/attributes-links-images) in the "Internet and Web" module.
- As you did for our 3/30 meeting, leave a comment in the margin of any part of *Walden* assigned for 4/6 that makes you curious to know more about how that passage might have changed during Thoreau's composition process.

### In class

- We'll discuss *Walden* and play with incorporating images into web pages.

***Class work:*** *In your folder for 4-6, share your journal file for the day with notes on incorporating images into web pages.*

## Wednesday, April 8

### Before class

- Read *Walden*, "Conclusion."
- Read [IIIF images]({{ site.url }}/mod-8/iiif-images).
- Leave a comment in the margin of "Conclusion" connecting the language there to language in any of the previous chapters of *Walden*. How does the language you identify in "Conclusion" enable Thoreau to echo, expand on, or put a new twist on the idea(s) expressed in the earlier chapter?

### In class

- We'll discuss *Walden* and play with IIIF images.

***Class work:*** *In your folder for 4-8, share your journal file for the day with notes on working with IIIF images.*

## Friday, April 10

### Before class

- No additional reading.

### In class

- We'll continue working with IIIF images.

***Class work:*** *In your folder for 4-10, share your journal file for the day with reflections on your own composition process. How does it compare to what you're seeing of Thoreau's composition process? On a scale from "totally scattershot" to "highly organized and intentional," where would you place your own composition process? If it's anything other than "totally scattershot," what are some of the things you do to make your own process at least somewhat organized and intentional? What role do you think technology has played in the difference between Thoreau's process and your own? Comparing Thoreau's process to your own, what aspects of revision seem to have been relatively untouched by technological change?*
