# Dates and Activities

## Monday, March 31

### Before class

- Read *Walden*, "Brute Neighbors," "House-Warming," and "Former Inhabitants; and Winter Visitors."
- Review [Attributes, Links, Images]({{ site.url }}/mod-7/attributes-links-images) in the "Internet and Web" module.
- Choose at least one of the following (you're welcome to do both!):
    - As you did for our 3/26 meeting, leave a comment in the margin of any part of *Walden* assigned for 3/31 that makes you curious to know more about how that passage might have changed during Thoreau's composition process.
    - Reply in the margin of *Walden* to a comment from one of the students in the group "Choate RH 2025." In your reply, take a "[Yes, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...)" approach, which doesn't preclude disagreeing but does require accepting the basic premise of the post to which you're replying. As part of your reply, you might also ask the original poster a follow-up question in an effort to better understand their viewpoint or make a connection between their comment and another idea or another passage. One way to find comments from the Choate students is to click the megaphone icon near the upper right of the web page and then click "Recent Comments in this Text." Be sure you're logged in when you do this.

### In class

- We'll discuss *Walden* and play with incorporating images into web pages.

***Class work:*** *In your folder for 3-31, share your journal file for the day with notes on incorporating images into web pages.*

## Wednesday, April 2

### Before class

- Read *Walden*, "Winter Animals," "The Pond in Winter," "Spring."
- Read [IIIF images]({{ site.url }}/mod-8/iiif-images).
- In the one of the chaptets of *Walden* assigned for 4/2, leave a comment in the margin of any description of nature that resonates with your own experience of nature&mdash;for example, any description that makes you think, "I've heard that!" or "I've seen that!" or "I know what he's talking about but I never thought about it that way!"

### In class

- We'll discuss *Walden* and play with IIIF images.

***Class work:*** *In your folder for 4-2, share your journal file for the day with notes on working with IIIF images.*

## Friday, April 4

### Before class

- No additional reading.

### In class

- We'll continue working with IIIF images.

***Class work:*** *In your folder for 4-4, share your journal file for the day with reflections on your own composition process. How does it compare to what you're seeing of Thoreau's composition process? On a scale from "totally scattershot" to "highly organized and intentional," where would you place your own composition process? If it's anything other than "totally scattershot," what are some of the things you do to make your own process at least somewhat organized and intentional? What role do you think technology has played in the difference between Thoreau's process and your own? Comparing Thoreau's process to your own, what aspects of revision seem to have been relatively untouched by technological change?*
