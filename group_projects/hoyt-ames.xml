          <note><!-- @resp="Ash" The addition of the "brute creations as were my neighbors" line, which speaks to the development of this section as a more meditative, philosophical section of the text.  Thoreau is describing the animals he is observing in this former deposit of information as "creations," albeit brute, and "neighbors," attesting to a more creative and metaphorical way of thinking about his surroundings. The digitL fluid text version indicates that this content is struck through, but the manuscript image demonstrates that this phrase is still in the content and not struck through. --></note>

Thoreau added and got rid of a lot of information here, but the similar text starting with "a long eared red-bellied field mouse" is the same between versions A and E, save a couple of small changes, like using "clothes" instead of my clothing.

          <note><!-- @resp="Ash" Everything after "there were scores of hitch pines" ends up being part of Winter Animals 13a. We consider this a distribution of the deposits of information across the text. Thoreau in version E is beginning to make sense of the deposits of information that exist in version A, so we see him rearranging this information as he notices the descriptions of pines is more logically sound and philosophically matchedin Winter Animals, and as the discussing preceding paragraph 9 is more logically sound and philosophically meaningful to the text.--></note>
