              <note><!-- This is Version G of House-Warming paragraph 5a. Version G mirrors the published edition well and there were not many changes to note about this version.

           <note><!-- This is Version A of House-Warming paragraph 5a. Using the fluid-text edition as a reference for this image was tough due to the way the text was organized after the first revision. I found a majority of this image in Chapter 1, not House-Warming. However, this demonstrates that Thoreau believed parts of this image to be better fitted for another chapted due to the content within being unrelated in some way. . --></note>
