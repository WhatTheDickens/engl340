# Module Description

Like the word "text," the word "editing" has different meanings depending on whether the context is literature or computing. In addition, even within the literary context, there are different ways to "edit," and different ways to produce an "edition" of a literary text. This module introduces you to *scholarly editing* as a literary activity and explains how that activity has been changed by the advent of digital technology.

# Learning Outcomes

At the completion of this module you should

1. Understand what sets scholarly editing apart from other kinds of editing
2. Understand what kind of reading a scholarly editor does
3. Understand what sets digital scholarly editing apart from scholarly editing without computers
