# Module Description

Henry David Thoreau began drafting his most famous work, *Walden*, in 1846, while still living at Walden Pond. Between then and 1854, when the work was published, he revised his text over and over. In the manuscript of *Walden* at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, it's possible to discern seven distinct draft stages of *Walden*. This module will introduce you to the manuscript and its history. In addition, the module will invite you to think about the challenges a scholarly editor faces in modeling a manuscript containing multiple drafts of a work.

# Outcomes/Activities

At the completion of this module you should

1. Understand the history of the *Walden* manuscript
2. Understand how a scholarly editor can model an author's revisions based on manuscript evidence
