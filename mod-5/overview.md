# Meet the Walden Manuscript

{: .intro}
Henry David Thoreau began drafting his most famous work, *Walden*, in 1846, while still living at Walden Pond. Between then and 1854, when the work was published, he revised his text over and over. In the manuscript of *Walden* at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, it's possible to discern seven distinct draft stages of *Walden*. This module introduces you to the manuscript and its history. In addition, the module invites you to think about the challenges a scholarly editor faces in modeling a manuscript containing multiple drafts of a work.
