*Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple-tree or an oak.* &mdash;Henry David Thoreau, *Walden*, "[Conclusion](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/walden/conclusion/conclusion-10-19)."

## What the course is about

In this course, we'll work together to understand how computers have changed the field of possibilities for studying books&mdash;in particular, books of the kind usually classified as "literature."

To do this, we'll need some base level of understanding for the two parts of our equation: computers on the one hand, books on the other. *Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet*, by Claire L. Evans, will help us establish a base-level understanding of computers that's not just technical but historical, with an emphasis on the frequently neglected role of women in the history of computing. *The Book*, by Amaranth Borsuk, will introduce us to the material and conceptual history of the book. 

We'll also need a particular book that we can keep coming back to in order to test what computers can help us do with literature. [*Walden*](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/walden/), by Henry David Thoreau, will be that book. Because *Walden* is a book that's partly about technology, in which the author has some provocative things to say about literature, it will also help us think more broadly about the relationship between books and computers.

Finally, everyone will need to have a working computer running the software required to do the things we want our computers to do with literature. Specifically, you'll need a laptop running a reasonably up-to-date version of Windows, macOS, or Linux. Chromebooks, tablets, and phones won't suffice. You'll need to bring your laptop to every class. If your laptop breaks down or is lost or stolen, you'll need to find a substitute.

## Who's teaching the course

 I'm Paul Schacht, Professor of English and [Director of the Center for Digital Learning](https://geneseo.edu/cdl) at SUNY Geneseo. I've taught here since 1985. I use he/him pronouns. I somehow can't quit X, where I'm [@WhatTheDickens](https://twitter.com/whatthedickens) and [@DigitalThoreau](https://twitter.com/digitalthoreau), but I rarely post there as either any longer. I can also be found on Mastodon ([WhatTheDickens@mastodon.online](https://mastodon.online/@whatthedickens), [DigitalThoreau@hcommons.social](https://hcommons.social/@digitalthoreau)) but am still settling in there.

## Who the course is for

 It's for *you*. But, you say, "I'm not very good with computers." Right. That's *why* this course is for you! You don't need any special computer skills to succeed in this course. The course will teach you everything you need to know. Some of the things we'll do together in the course may feel intimidating at first. Don't be afraid! It's really not as complicated as it looks. Approach this course with a [growth mindset](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/growth-mindset), come to class, do the work (which isn't that hard&mdash;really!), *ask questions when you have them and seek help when you get stuck* (remember, *there is no such thing as a dumb question, and everyone gets stuck*), and by the end of the semester you probably won't feel "not very good with computers" any more. (Interested in the neuroscience behind growth mindset? See [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5836039/) on the website of the National Institutes of Health.) Of course, if you already feel confident with computers, this course is for *you*, too. If you follow the advice just offered, you're sure to learn all kinds of things you don't already know. 

## When and where we'll meet

- Mondays and Wednesdays, 12:30 pm &ndash; 1:45 pm; Fridays, 1:30 pm &ndash; 1:20 pm, Newton 206
- Final meeting (attendance mandatory) Wednesday, May 14, 12 pm &ndash; 3:20 pm, Newton 206

## How and when to find me

- Wednesday, 2:30 pm &ndash; 4:00 pm in South 347
- Any free time that works for you at [https://schacht.youcanbook.me](https://schacht.youcanbook.me)

## Learning outcomes

### Individual learning outcomes

What will you know and be able to do as a result of taking this course? First, [because this is a 300-level English course](https://www.geneseo.edu/english/programs-english#LearningOutcomesinEnglishLiterature), you’ll improve your

- ability to read texts in relation to history
- understanding of how texts are related to social and cultural categories (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, ability), enterprises (e.g. philosophy, science, politics), and institutions (e.g., of religion, of education)
- understanding of how language as a system or linguistic change over time inform literature as an aesthetic object, expressive medium, or social document

In addition, as a result of taking ENGL 340, you should

- understand, at a basic level, the computational dimension of language and literature
- understand, at a basic level, some common uses of computation and computational tools in the study of literature
- feel prepared to use computational methods and tools for literary analysis and interpretation in another literature course
- know more about how your computer works than you did before

### Community learning outcomes

What will we accomplish in this course as a community?

- Produce new knowledge (new for this community) about literature and literary study in the digital age
- Share knowledge about literature and literary study in the digital age in accordance with scholarly conventions
- Discuss and debate ideas about individual literary works and about the nature of literature and literary criticism in ways that respect the diversity of the community
- Help one another when we’re stuck

### Module-specific outcomes

On the "Outcomes/Activities" page for each module, you'll find learning outcomes specific to that module.

## Assessment

How will you know if you’ve met the individual outcomes? How will we know if we’ve met the community outcomes?

- You’ll keep a journal in which you write regularly about what you’re learning in the course
- You’ll post to a blog and reflect on your learning in this course
- You’ll contribute to a group project in which you make use of particular computing skills that you acquire in the course

## What we'll read

- The content of these modules
- Amaranth Borsuk, *The Book*
- Claire L. Evans, *Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet*
- Henry D. Thoreau, [*Walden*](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org/walden/)
- Assorted other readings

## Requirements and evaluation

Your final grade in this course will be based on the number of points you earn out of a maximum of 100 points. You’ll earn points for the activities listed below. You must complete all assigned work to pass the course.

- **Blog**: You'll earn up to **30** points for two blog posts (15 points each) in which you reflect on your learning in this course. (Due <s>2/19</s> 3/1 and 4/26.) 
- **Class work**: You'll earn up to **40** points for in-class work submitted *by the end of each class meeting.* (Typically, 1 point per timely submission.)
- **Project work**: You'll earn up to **30** points for a group project to which you contribute, with **10** of those points coming from your personal contribution to the project and a final blog post you'll write about your work on it.

## Tools and accounts

In addition to a working laptop computer running an up-to-date version of macOS, Windows, or Linux, you'll need some additional tools and accounts. The modules explain how to obtain the last two of these, so don't rush out in search of them until we've discussed them in class.

- An account at [English @ SUNY Geneseo](https://sunygeneseoenglish.org)
- An account at [The Readers' Thoreau](https://commons.digitalthoreau.org)
- The Microsoft Teams app (available to all Geneseo users; the web version of Teams won't suffice)
- Visual Studio Code, BBEdit, or another plain-text editor with syntax-highlighting (explained in module)
- Git Bash or WSL for Windows (Windows users only; explained in module)

## Take care of yourself

It’s hard work being a student! You can improve your chances of success by eating well, getting enough sleep, and making wise choices. **If you need help, ask for it.** [Student Health and Counseling](https://www.geneseo.edu/health) can help you if you’re sick or need psychological or emotional support. A variety of [Campus Learning Centers](https://www.geneseo.edu/library/center-academic-excellence), including the [Writing Learning Center](https://www.geneseo.edu/english/leadership-and-hands-learning#writing-learning-center), offer academic support services. **And then there’s me.** [Schedule an appointment](https://schacht.youcanbook.me) to see me in my office or meet online for help with assignments, to tell me if you’re facing basic obstacles to success such as food insecurity, or to continue the conversation about readings and topics in the course. If reading or discussing certain kinds of content in this course might prove traumatic for you, let me know and we’ll work together to figure out a reasonable solution. You should be prepared for the fact that some works on the syllabus contain depictions of or allusions to violence and sexuality.

## Think about others

- Express yourself honestly but respectfully
- Practice [forbearance](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forbearance) when offended by others, even as you exercise your right to explain your reasons for taking offense
- Consider how the world looks to someone who is not you
- Do your best to address others as they prefer to be addressed

## Accessibility services

SUNY Geneseo is dedicated to providing students equal and comprehensive access to college-wide programs, services, and campus facilities. The [Office of Accessibility Services](https://www.geneseo.edu/accessibility-office) (OAS) coordinates reasonable accommodations and auxiliary aids and services designed to ensure full participation and equal access for students with disabilities.
