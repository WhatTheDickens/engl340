# Module Description

In this module, you'll work in groups to develop a revision narrative that attempts to give a plausible explanation for changes Thoreau made, in revising *Walden*, to a passage or selection of related passages. Each group will select its own passage or passages to examine, develop its revision narrative, encode a manuscript page relevant to that narrative in valid TEI, document the challenges the group faced and any solutions to those challenges, and share the revision narrative and account of challenges in a group presentation at our final meeting of the semester. For more information on how groups will do their work, see the page [Project Details]({{ site.url }}/mod-9/project-details) in this module.

# Learning Outcomes

At the completion of this module you should

1. Understand the difference between modeling manuscript alterations and modeling an author's revision process
2. Be able to build and share a revision narrative, together with your group, about the set of alterations to *Walden* your group has chosen to study
3. Be able to create a simple, valid TEI file modeling selected alterations to a *Walden* manuscript page your group has chosen to study
