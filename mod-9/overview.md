# Group Projects

{: .intro}
In this module, you'll work in groups to develop a revision narrative that attempts to give a plausible explanation for changes Thoreau made, in revising *Walden*, to a passage or selection of related passages. Each group will select its own passage or passages to examine, develop its revision narrative, encode a manuscript page relevant to that narrative in valid TEI, document the challenges the group faced and any solutions to those challenges, and share the revision narrative and account of challenges in a group presentation at our final meeting of the semester. To get started by reviewing the dates and assignments for the module, click "Outcomes/Activities" below or in the left navigation menu.
