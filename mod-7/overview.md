# Internet and Web

{: .intro}
Once modern digital computers were developed in the twentieth century, it became necessary to figure out how to get them to communicate with each other, and then how to build a usable information ecosystem atop the ever-expanding network of interconnected machines. This module introduces you to some basic concepts for understanding how these problems were solved, to the encoding languages emerging from these solutions that now stand at the heart of the digital ecosystem&mdash;HTML and CSS&mdash; and to remedies for inequities and injustices that continue to haunt that ecosystem.
