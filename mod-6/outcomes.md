# Module Description

A digital scholarly edition of a literary work can do more than simply reproduce an author's text as pixels on a screen, as opposed to ink on paper. By using a specialized encoding language to describe the features of the text, a digital scholarly edition can make it possible to display the text in different ways for different purposes, and to mine the text for significant patterns. In this module, you'll learn about a specialized encoding language called "TEI"&mdash;an abbreviation for both the language and the consortium of editors who created and maintain it: the *Text Encoding Initiative*.

# Outcomes/Activities

At the completion of this module you should

1. Understand the value of modeling textual data using a machine-readable markup language
2. Understand how XML/TEI is used by digital scholarly editors to model textual data
